# HTML and CSS: Running with love 🧡

Hi there! My name is Manuela Inclán and I created this project based on a design provided by Zeplin. The website is responsive, pixel perfect, and built using **flex** and **grid** 🎨💻.

I hope you like it! 😊

## This exercise demonstrates that I have learned the following 📋:

### General

- Use an appropriate file and folder structure for a web project, and properly link different files.
- Use **version control** with branches to manage a code project.

### **HTML**

- Write perfectly indented HTML code.
- Create well-structured HTML code with correct syntax.
- Use appropriate HTML **semantic tags** for each piece of content.

### **CSS / Sass**

- Write perfectly indented CSS code.
- Create well-structured Sass code with correct syntax.
- Use Sass features such as **variables**, **nesting**, and **partials**.
- Use CSS code that heavily utilizes **class selectors**, not tag or id selectors.
- Use English class selectors.
- Use the CSS **box model** appropriately to specify size, padding, and margins.
- Use **text and background styles** for different types of elements.
- Use **flexbox** appropriately to organize elements in flexible boxes.
- Use **media queries** to adjust designs to different device sizes.
- Use **positioning** to place fixed and absolute elements on the screen.
- Use CSS **grid** to place elements using a grid.
- Use CSS **transitions** to add dynamism to a web project.

### Additionally, I focused on learning how to:

- Use **animations** 🎬
- Use **mixins** 🍹
- Use **variables** 💻

## Tech 💻

Starring:
[Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit) - An amazing template that allowed me to use a local host, SASS, HTML Template Engines and gulp. For more information you may visit [the Kit repository](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit)

### Built with 🔨

- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- HTML
- SASS
- GULP

## Development ⌨️

To carry out this project, I followed the guidelines set by the designer in Zeplin.
I sketched out a diagram with pencil and paper to organize myself effectively. This allowed me to think about the best way to divide the project into partials.
I started the design with a Mobile First approach and then added the necessary mediaqueries to make the design adapt to different devices.
I used SASS to style the project; I really like its nesting capabilities as it allows me to work in a more organized and efficient manner.

This is how my partials look like:

## Want to clone my repository? 🐑🐑

Remember that this repository was done using the [Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/adalab-web-starter-kit) so I highly recommend to visit the link provided before running the proyect.

<sub>[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and Gulp are required <sub/>

After you clone the repository you must:

1. Install dependencies. You will only have to do this once.

```sh
npm install
```

2. Start the proyect. This must be done everytime you code and will open a local host that will update in real time

```sh
npm start
```

3.  If as me, you happen to use GitHub Pages you may send your code to production using

```sh
npm run push-docs
```

<sub>PD: You will have to set your GitHub Page as master branch /docs folder.
For Gulp installing you may run

```sh
npm -g install gulp-cli
```
